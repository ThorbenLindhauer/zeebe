/**
 * Used for dealing with backpressure in replication

 * <p>Optimized datastructure allowing to record event sizes by position so that we can calculate
 * the size of the "in flight" dataset during replication.
 *
 * <p>For each event position that has not yet been acknowledged by the follower, the size of the
 * corresponding event (in bytes) is recorded. When the follower acknowledges an event, all event
 * sizes up to (and including) this position are removed.
 *
 * <p>The datastructure is array backed and optimized for linear scanning access. The arrays are
 * automatically grown to the necessary size. Once this state is reached, it is garbage free in a
 * ring-buffer like fashion.
