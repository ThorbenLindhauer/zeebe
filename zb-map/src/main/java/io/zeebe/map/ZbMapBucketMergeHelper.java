  /**
   * Merging rules for normal buckets:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Bucket is last bucket. Only in that case a bucket can be removed, since the bucketAddress
   *       consists of the bucket buffer id and the bucket offset.
   *   <li>Bucket depth is equal to the depth of the bucket which should be merged. If this is not
   *       the case then the parent bucket was split again. This other bucket have to be merged
   *       before with the parent. This is necessary to calculate the id and update the hash table
   *       correctly.
   *   <li>Parent fill count plus the bucket fill count have to be less then the maximum bucket fill
   *       count. Would result the merging in a full parent bucket on the next add block a new split
   *       have to be done. This split will create the same bucket which was merged before, since
   *       this makes no sense we only merge if the relocation will not result in a filled bucket!
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Are the rules above satisfied and the bucket is or has no overflow bucket, then the
   * following is done.
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Remaining blocks of the bucket are relocated to the parent bucket.
   *   <li>Bucket is removed from the BucketBufferArray.
   *   <li>Hash table is updated with the parent bucket address.
   *   <li>The new last bucket is tried to merged. This calls recursively this method.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <p>Since this method is recursively it is possible that one merge call can clean up a bunch of
   * empty or mergable buckets. It is also possible that merge is called on a bucket which has as ID
   * {@link BucketBufferArray#ABANDONED_BUCKET}. In that case the bucket will be removed if it is
   * the last one. Like on the normal merge we will call again {@link #tryMergingBuckets(long, int)}
   * with the new last bucket address. If it is not the last one the method returns. Also if the
   * bucket id and the depth is zero, which means the first bucket was not splitted before the
   * method simply returns.
   *
   * <p>As mentioned before overflow buckets and buckets which have a overflow bucket are handled
   * differently. An overflow bucket can be identified on the bucket depth, which is equal to {@link
   * BucketBufferArray#OVERFLOW_BUCKET}. If the overflow pointer is set on a bucket this means the
   * bucket has an overflow bucket. <b>Has overflow bucket, then {@link
   * #tryMergeBucketWhichHasOverflowBucket(long, long)} is called and the following procedure is
   * done.</b>
   *
   * <p>In that case we try to merge the overflow bucket in the current bucket. Here also exist
   * different cases:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Overflow bucket is removable and blocks of overflow bucket can be relocated to the
   *       current bucket, then we relocate the blocks and remove the overflow bucket. Like on the
   *       normal merge we will call again {@link #tryMergingBuckets(long, int)} with the new last
   *       bucket address.
   *   <li>Overflow bucket is removable but can't be merged, then nothing happens.
   *   <li>Overflow bucket is not removable but it can be merged Existing blocks are relocated to
   *       the current bucket and the overflow pointer is removed. Overflow bucket is marked as
   *       removable, see {@link BucketBufferArray#ABANDONED_BUCKET}.
   *   <li>Overflow bucket is not removable and can't be merged, then nothing happens.
   * </ul>
   *
   * <b>Is overflow bucket, then {@link #tryMergeOverflowBucket(long, int, int)} is called and the
   * following procedure is done.</b>
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>Is overflow bucket removable and the block can be relocated to the parent/original
   *       bucket, then this will be done. Like on the normal merge we will call again {@link
   *       #tryMergingBuckets(long, int)} with the new last bucket address.
   *   <li>If the overflow bucket is not removable the next steps are depending, whether the
   *       overflow bucket has a overflow bucket or not.
   *       <ul>
   *         <li>
   *             <p>Is the overflow bucket without next overflow buckets, then we try to merge it
   *             into the parent/original bucket. Since per definition overflow buckets are only
   *             created if a bucket is full and if we remove a block from a bucket with an overflow
   *             bucket it tries to merge it, see next bullet point. So we can assume that all
   *             overflow buckets in between the parent bucket and the current overflow bucket are
   *             not mergeable with the current bucket. We only have to check if it is possible to
   *             merge the overflow bucket into the parent bucket. If the blocks of overflow bucket
   *             are relocatable to the parent bucket, this will be done and the overflow bucket
   *             pointer is removed. Overflow bucket is marked as removable, see {@link
   *             BucketBufferArray#ABANDONED_BUCKET}.
   *         <li>If the overflow bucket has also an overflow bucket pointer it tries to merge this
   *             overflow bucket into the current one.
   *             <ul>
   *               <li>Are the blocks relocatable to the current overflow bucket and the overflow
   *                   bucket is removable, then this is done and the overflow bucket is removed.
   *                   Like on the normal merge we will call again {@link #tryMergingBuckets(long,
   *                   int)} with the new last bucket address.
   *               <li>Are the blocks relocatable to the current overflow bucket and the overflow
   *                   bucket is NOT removable, then the blocks are relocated and the overflow
   *                   bucket is marked as removable, see {@link
   *                   BucketBufferArray#ABANDONED_BUCKET}.
   *               <li>Otherwise nothing happens.
   *             </ul>
   *       </ul>
   * </ul>
   *

   *

   * Bucket 0 [A, B]
   * Bucket 1 [C, D] -> O3
   * Bucket 2 [E, F] -> O1
