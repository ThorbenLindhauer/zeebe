   * <strong>Use with care</strong>
   *
   * <p>If you need to perform an async action (like fetching some data) while processing the event,
   * you can supply a future here. Note that:
   *
   * <ul>
   *   <li>the async action should not be a side effect (in that case use {@link
   *       StreamProcessorController#executeSideEffects()}).
   *   <li>if the outcome of the action influences the outcome of processing the event (ie. based on
   *       the return value of the async action either a command succeeds or is rejected, make sure
   *       that reprocessing produces the same results. There are two cases:
   *       <ul>
   *         <li>In case the async action always returns the same data no extra care is necessary
   *         <li>In case the async action does not always return the same data, make sure to a) send
   *             responses to a client based on the event that is written to the stream, b) do not
   *             update state on the command but rather on the event.
